# autotestv3.py
is a small tool that uses testFramework.exe in a better way.
It executes the testFramework.exe separately for each individual test and restarts the execution for the next test. In this case, there are no dependencies between the test cases, which sometimes lead to errors during testing.



## Deployment

notice that python must be installed on the machine.
To deploy this tool run with cli:

```bash
  autotestv3.py
```
